Basics of Numpy and Data Loading
Q1: A CSV file has been provided to you at this link. The given dataset is related to superstore
products and contains 21 columns. In the given dataset, “Sales” is the target variable (i.e., the
output).
i) Load the CSV data with the help of pandas and report the information regarding column
labels, column data types, memory usage, the number of non-null values in each column and
statistical details like mean, count, and standard deviation.
ii) Find out the numerical and categorical features from the data.

Q2: With the help of NumPy operations, solve the following questions.
i) Create an array of random floats with a range starting from 0 to 2.
ii) Show the standard deviation and mean of the above-generated data.
iii) Generate a random matrix of size (3,3) and find out the determinant, inverse, eigen values,
and eigen vectors of that.

Q3 (OPTIONAL): Using the webcam on your laptop/computer, read and save a photograph of
yourself using any one of the following libraries: OpenCV/Python Pillow /Scikit Image
